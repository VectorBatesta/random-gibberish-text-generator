# random-gibberish-text-generator
Generates multiple randomized text samples using configurable character sets. The total text length and number of outputs are controlled by macrovariables, with optional jitter applied to vary sizes dynamically. Useful for producing synthetic text, stress-testing text systems, or generating controlled gibberish across different scripts.
